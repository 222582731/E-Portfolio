1. Situation:
    * During the Work Readiness Programme, I participated in a Business Communication module/chapter focused on developing effective professional communication skills.

   * My task was to demonstrate an understanding of different types of communication, when to use formal language, how to apply an appropriate tone in business emails, and the correct etiquette for virtual meetings

3. Action:
   * I engaged in the online module by answering interactive questions about business tone, non-verbal communication, and professionalism in digital settings.
I learned the importance of body language, clarity, and formality in business contexts.
Additionally, I practiced identifying suitable tones for various professional situations and understanding how to maintain professionalism during video conferences.

4. Result:
   * Completing the module improved my awareness of how small details such as tone, formality, and visual presentation influence professional interactions.
I now feel more confident composing professional emails, participating in meetings, and maintaining proper etiquette in both face to face and virtual communication settings.
